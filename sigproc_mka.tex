% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{5} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\begin{abstract}
High quality data is important for data science and data analysis. Unfortunately,  digitally collected data often suffers from many data quality issues, such as duplicate, incorrect or incomplete data. A common approach for counteracting such issues is to formulate a set of data agnostic cleaning rules intended to identify and repair incorrect, duplicate and missing data. There is a need for new approaches to overcome the limits of existing heuristic data cleaning solution. \note{Why? Which limits?} Therefore, we propose an approach to data cleaning based on Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) and probabilistic inference. We argue that a well-known formalism - Markov logic - is a natural fit for modeling interacting data quality rules in a flexible and extensible way. We show how data quality rules expressed as first-order formulas directly translate into a predictive model in an SRL framework. This approach allows the usage of probabilistic joint inference over interleaved data cleaning rules to improve data quality. \note{Mention contributions!} In an experimental study we demonstrate the viability of our proposed approach. \note{Mention details of best experimental outcomes, e.g. improved the accuracy by a factor of X.y compared to state-of-the-art solutions.}
